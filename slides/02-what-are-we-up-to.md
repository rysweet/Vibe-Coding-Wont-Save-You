## What are we up to here?

**Our Goal:** The developer comes away with a set of practices that they can apply to their own work, and a set of tools that they can use to explore what works for them.

This course is designed as a self-directed learning experience for developers wanting to learn more about collaborating with AI in their development workflow. It is necessarily a point-in-time snapshot, in a field that is **changing hourly**.

This course represents a set of practices that has been working for me, sometimes. Its not a comprehensive survey of what is available.
