## But doesn't the AI produce lots of garbage code?

- **Yes, it does. Frequently.**
- But increasingly it produces code that is useful, and sometimes even surprisingly good
- By setting up the right guardrails and paying close attention to what it is doing, you can get it to produce code that is useful, functional, sometimes even innovative
- It can help you discover how to do things you didn't know how to do, and it can let you move very quickly through the parts of the code that you already know how to do
- That means you can focus on the parts of the problem that are genuinely novel and interesting
