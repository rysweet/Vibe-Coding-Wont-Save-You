## GH Copilot Agent Mode

**The Good:** Microsoft team I can give feedback to; relatively cautious; lots of model choice; BYOM possible.

Use `./github/copilot-instructions.md`.

**The Bad:** optimized for speed over quality; barely autonomous – you must approve nearly every command.

## GH Agents

**The good:** runs in the GitHub cloud on your repo, driven by issues, forces you to think a little more.

**The bad:** very cautious; hard to spot problems while they happen; troubleshooting isn't interactive.
