## Brief overview of tools out there …OMG the agents are everywhere

- **OpenAI Codex** – works on your repo in a VM in the cloud
- **Claude Code** – CLI you can run in your terminal
- Both let you dialog about what you want and "spill their guts" about every step they take, with guard-rails
- **GH Copilot Agent Mode** – runs in VS/VS Code; short bursts, not very autonomous
- **GH Agents** – work on your repo in GitHub, driven by issues
- **Cline / Roo Code** – Roo is an improved fork of Cline; OSS and similar to (better than) Agent Mode
- Long tail of others: Augment, DevN, Windsurf, etc.

## Where I'm at today – chasing my own tail?

- Loved Claude Code; Codex was second, but cost was too high…
- Always use VS Code Insiders and update daily
- Settled on Roo Code as my primary tool; now like it better than Claude Code or Codex
- Frequent detours to ChatGPT and GH Copilot Agent Mode
- Try Agent Mode every other day (be a good citizen – it *is* getting better)
- Check in regularly with colleagues who are also experimenting
